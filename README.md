# Nest-api 📝

## Project overview 🚀

I wanted to get better at back-end development so I created a CRUD application using nest.js framework

## Devlopment overview 🔥

- Test-Driven-Devlopment: E2E tests for all the requests.
- NestJS architecture: Controllers for FE/BE requests communictaions and Services/Providers for buisness logic and ORM communictaions with the Prisma module.
